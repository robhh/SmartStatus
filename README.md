SmartStatus Watch App
=====================

The SmartStatus watch app only works in conjunction with the Smartwatch+ app for jailbroken iOS devices. [Smartwatch+](cydia:///package/com.hesze.smartwatchplus) is available through the BigBoss repository in Cydia.

This code provides an example of how to communicate with Smartwatch+ and how to use status information from your iOS device within your own watch face or app. The status information that is currently available to you through Smartwatch+ is

* Unread email count
* Unread SMS/iMessage count
* Missed phone calls
* iPhone battery percentage
* Current weather
